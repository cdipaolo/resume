\begin{rSection}{EXPERIENCE}

\begin{rSubsection}{Yelp -- {\it San Francisco, CA}}{May 2017 - August 2017}{Intern -- {\sl Ad Creative}}

\item Project lead for implementing the first trained model for advertisement photo selection
    within Yelp. Allocated engineering work and contributed heavily to model training and
    deployment infrastructure.
\item Crafted the transition from an initial linear click-through rate prediction model to
    a deep neural network (augmented ResNet) implemented in PyTorch.
\item Designed, organized engineers, and heavily contributed to an internal web app for
    automated Bayesian analysis of Yelp A/B tests with potential to be used across all of Ads.
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Yelp -- {\it San Francisco, CA}}{May 2016 - August 2016}{Intern -- {\sl Spam Team}}

\item Primary contributor to a widely used database replication service marshalling Kafka messages into MySQL.
\item Re-trained a stale language model for spam detection. Improved real world performance significantly
    and streamlined re-training for future use. A year later it's the best performing
    spam model in that ecosystem.
\item Integral in design and implementation of a model development framework used across the spam team. Implemented
    first model (currently in production) using this framework.
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Veritone Media -- {\it Newport Beach, CA}}{July 2015 - August 2015}{Intern -- {\sl Public company giving corporations actionable insight into media.}}

\item Developed a production ready, open source sentiment analysis engine using my own machine learning library (using a Naive Bayes model on IMDB data.)
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Soulsoup -- {\it Newport Beach, CA}}{December 2014 - August 2015}{Lead Engineer -- {\sl Non-profit networking people who give with people who need. Funded by Veritone founder.}}

\item Developed a scalable API in Go interacting with a PostgreSQL database and a
    mobile frontend.

\begin{rSection}{OPEN SOURCE}

\begin{rSubsection}{GOML}{\textsf{github.com/cdipaolo/goml}}{Creator}

\item Developed the only machine learning library to use data channels (as an option over batch learning) to train models in an online and parallelizable way.
\item Wrote the second most starred Golang machine learning libary on GitHub ($>740$ stars).
\item Implemented 11 diverse machine learning models in a well documented, heavily tested, and intuitive API.
